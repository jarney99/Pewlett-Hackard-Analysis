# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
We were tasked with determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We created a query using SQL that will print these tables for us. 

## Results
  * With our retirement table we were able to see every employee that was eligible for retirement. 
  * We were also able to see how long every employee has worked in their current position. 
  * We were able to see what position each employee retired with.
  * Based on this information we found out that most employees that retired had senior positions. 

## Summary
We created tables to find out information about retiring employees, and from this we were able to determiine that in the next few years there will be a lot of positions to fill. A lot of the roles that employees were retiring in are senior level roles, so we will have to fill those roles after they're retired. From this information we can start to analyze what employees are best able to fill the positions.
